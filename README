Security Project, Author: La Marra Antonio 2014

This is an academic project that involves the usage of a protocol for key establishment between a client and a server.
Client and server share a secret that can be used in order to establisdh a secure connection between them. 

The protocol has been proved with BAN logic, in this project, in order to guarantee an higher level of secrecy
I will use also steganography. The library used for encrypting and decrypting data is the OPENSSL library and the code is
written in C++. 

Order of points to fullfill:
1) Steganography algorithm 
2) the part related to encrypting and decrypting
3) the whole protocol
4) the exchange of an encrypted file.

Since steganography may or may not be related to encryption (it is not necessarily to encrypt a message that will be included in a stego image)
I will use this method and I will see what happens.
